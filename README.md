# README

Explorations on how to embed simple components in hugo markdown content as an alternative to mdx.


## Use case

I would love to create useful, interactive articles (Josw W Cumeau's blog is really inspiring).

## Restrictions

The goal is to have the components scoped to the page bundles, and move them to a global scope (layouts folder) only when a component really needs to be shared.
This way the page bundles act as self-contained mini-apps.
